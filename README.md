Hello! I'm Wander, a passionate coder with a strong affinity for Python, though I'm also proficient in Java and have been delving into Julia. My main area of interest lies in the realm of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, where I constantly seek to expand my knowledge and skills.

I am particularly intrigued by the intersection between supervised and unsupervised learning in Large Language Models (LLMs). I believe that understanding and improving the synergy between these two learning paradigms is key to unlocking even more potent and efficient AI systems.

Now I am finishing my web development degree and coding by myself.
